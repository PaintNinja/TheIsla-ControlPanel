				<h2>Accessing the console</h2>
				<div class="ui green ribbon label">Easy difficulty</div>
				<p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to access the console so that you can run any command as a top-rank user.</p>
				<p>It's quite easy really, but just in case you're not sure, just keep reading... I'll tell you how to do it step by step. :)</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open up The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
					<li>Click on "Console" under the server section</li>
					<li>Enter the password to login to the console</li>
				</ol>
				<p>That's it! :D</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Applying ranks</h2>
				<p>You'll probably want to know how to apply ranks from the console, so I've made a tutorial for that too! :D</p>
				<h3>Rank list</h3>
				<div class="ui green ribbon label">Easy difficulty</div>
				<p>The following ranks are safe and available for you to apply:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Member</li>
					<li>VIP</li>
					<li>Legend</li>
					<li>SemiModerator - ChatMod</li>
					<li>LegendChatMod - ChatMod with Legend perks</li>
					<li>Moderator</li>
					<li>VIPModerator - Moderator with VIP perks</li>
					<li>CM - Community Manager</li>
					<li>Co-Owner</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<h3>How to apply a rank to a specific user</h3>
				<div class="ui ribbon label">Medium difficulty</div>
				<p>This has been tagged as "Medium difficulty" because it takes a while to get used to and if done wrong,
				it's not obvious unless you know the symptoms of PEX errors.</p>
				<p>To apply a rank to a specific user, use the following syntax: <code>pex user USERNAME group set RANK</code></p>
				<i class="info icon"></i><i>Note: USERNAME and RANK are cAsE-SeNsItIvE, so the rank <code>legend</code> is completely different from <code>Legend</code> and the user <code>Notch</code> is
				completely different from <code>notch</code>.</i>
				<h4>Examples</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><code>pex user Notch group set VIP</code></li>
					<li><code>pex user LOFTYBOY group set Moderator</code></li>
					<li><code>pex user LOFTYBOY group set Co-Owner</code></li>
					<li><code>pex user TJBennerzz group set Member</code></li>
					<li><code>pex user Kasanii group set CM</code></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Dealing with duped/hacked in-game money</h2>
				<div class="ui ribbon label">Incomplete</div>
				<p>I wasn't really sure whether this should go in the Console, Seamless maintenance or in-game economy management,
				so I decided to put it here and mention all the methods of dealing with hacked or duped in-game money.</p>
				<p>Obviously you want to make sure the server's as moderated as possible, but there's times when staff just 'aint enough -
				like when you gotta sort someone out who has a ridiculous amount of in-game money in their <code>/balance</code>. This is
				where you come in! Only <b>Admins or higher</b> are allowed to manage the server's bank, as this is not as simple as just
				remove the money and you're done. You need to know the root cause of the issue, as well as sorting out the issues caused by
				the root at the same time.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Find potentially duped/hacked in-game money</h3>
				<div class="ui ribbon label">Medium difficulty</div>
				<p>There are various methods of doing this...</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In-game</li>
					<li>Console</li>
					<li>Wizard - in-game</li>
					<li>Wizard - console</li>
				</ol>
				<h4><i class="gamepad icon"></i>Method 1: In-game</h4>
				<p>This method is fairly easy - as long as you are able to join the server for a bit without getting asked for
				help or needing to sort out other stuff - which is very unlikely.</p>
				<p>Anyway, here's how step-by-step for this method:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Start CraftMine</li>
					<li>Join the server</li>
					<li>Type <code>/baltop</code></li>
					<li>Look for users with a suspiciously high amount of money</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If someone has been on the server for a very long time then they are allowed to have loads of money - with exceptions - of course</li>
						<li>If someone is fairly new to the server then anything over £3k is suspicious</li>
						<li>If someone has only been welcomed to the server just a couple of hours ago, anything over £500 is suspicious</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
				<ul>
					<li>If there's something suspicious, carry on to the next section of this tutorial</li>
					<li>If there's nothing suspicious, then you don't need to take any action and you're all up-to-date! :)</li>
				</ul>
				<h4><i class="terminal icon"></i>Method 2: Console</h4>
				<p>This method is similar to method 1, except that you won't need to help anyone or sort out other stuff.
				This is the preferred method, unless you are already in-game - where method 1 would be preferred if that is the case.</p>
				<p>Here's how step-by-step for method 2:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open up The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
					<li>Click on "Console" under the server section</li>
					<li>Enter the password to login to the console</li>
					<li>Type <code>/baltop</code></li>
					<li>Look for users with a suspiciously high amount of money</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If someone has been on the server for a very long time then they are allowed to have loads of money - with exceptions - of course</li>
						<li>If someone is fairly new to the server then anything over £3k is suspicious</li>
						<li>If someone has only been welcomed to the server just a couple of hours ago, anything over £500 is suspicious</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
				<ul>
					<li>If there's something suspicious, carry on to the next section of this tutorial</li>
					<li>If there's nothing suspicious, then you don't need to take any action and you're all up-to-date! :)</li>
				</ul>
				<i class="info icon"></i><i>Yeah I know, there's more steps on this one than the first method, but this is much quicker than waiting for the game to load, I can
				guarantee you that!</i>
				<h4><i class="gamepad icon"></i>Method 3: Wizard - in-game</h4>
				<p>This is really the same as method 1 - but guided.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open up The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
					<li>Hover over "Guides" in the menu on the left</li>
					<li>Click on "Find potentially duped/hacked in-game money - in-game" under the "Wizard" section on the left menu</li>
					<li>Follow the guided steps</li>
				</ol>
				<h4><i class="terminal icon"></i>Method 4: Wizard - console</h4>
				<p>This is really the same as method 2 - but guided.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open up The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
					<li>Click on "Find potentially duped/hacked in-game money - console" under the "Wizard" section on the left menu</li>
					<li>Follow the guided steps</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Grave cleanup</h2>
				<p>As you may have noticed, you rarely see graves at spawn, the market, etc... if ever! - That's because I go around almost
				daily maintaining the server's services by destroying any graves in specific areas. This keeps the place looking new, clean and
				welcoming rather than cluttered with loads of old graves all over the place.</p>
				<p>In this tutorial, I'll show you how to do it! :D</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Knowing where to clean up and where not to</h3>
				<div class="ui green ribbon label">Easy difficulty</div>
				<p>This is very important, because the last thing you want is players complaining that their graves have suddenly gone when they
				were going to get their stuff back later.</p>
				<u>Where you should cleanup</u>
				<ul>
					<li>Anywhere at <code>/spawn</code></li>
					<li>In the safezone areas at <code>/warp wild</code></li>
				</ul>
				<u>Where you should leave alone</u>
				<ul>
					<li>Random places in the wilderness</li>
					<li>Faction land (apart from Safezone and Warzone)</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<h3>How to cleanup the graves</h3>
				<div class="ui green ribbon label">Easy difficulty</div>
				<p>It's quite simple really, but here's how just incase you're unsure...</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to the grave you want to remove</li>
					<li>Make sure your inventory is empty</li>
					<li>Type <code>/gm c</code> to change to creative mode</li>
					<li>Hit the grave</li>
					<li>Type <code>/ci</code></li>
					<li>Type <code>/gm s</code> to change back to survival mode</li>
				</ol>
				<p>That's it! :)</p>
