				<h2>Applying donation rewards</h2>
				<p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to apply donation rewards to players who have donated.</p>
				<i>Note: This only applies to ranks, rank upgrades and the unban package. Everything else in the donation store is automated. :)</i>
				<p></p>
				<p>Firstly, you can only apply donation rewards if you have been notified that the player has donated through Enjin, with the exception
				of event prizes with my permission.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Knowing when someone has donated</h3>
				<div class="ui ribbon label">Medium difficulty</div>
				<p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Going to the server's website and checking your inbox</li>
					<li>Using the guided mode in The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>I'll explain method 1 and then method 2...</p>
				<h4>Method 1</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Open up The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
					<li>Click on "Inbox" under the community section</li>
					<li>Look for a recent unread message with the subject "Purchase notification"</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If there is no recent unread message with that subject, you are up to date and don't need to apply a donation reward</li>
						<li>If there is a recent unread message with that subject, open it up</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Check to see if the message is already replied to by me, indicating that I've already applied the reward</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If already applied, you don't need to apply the donation reward again</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
				<p>That's method one for you... Just open up your Enjin inbox, check if there's a notification and check if I've already done it, simple
				when I just say it like that, right?</p>
				<h4>Method 2</h4>
				<p>This way's basically the same as method one, but... you're guided whilst doing it. Handy if you forgot how to do it but don't want to
				read a long and boring tutorial like this one, for example. ;)</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open up The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
					<li>Hover over "Guides" in the menu on the left</li>
					<li>Click on "Check if someone has donated"</li>
					<li>Follow the guided steps</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Sure, this may be easier but it's a lot slower than the first method. Once you're used to method one you'll find that it's miles
				quicker than this method. But still, this can still help if you're new to the process or forgot it. :)</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Knowing the appropriate donation rewards to apply</h3>
				<div class="ui green ribbon label">Easy difficulty</div>
				<p>Obviously you don't want to muck up and give someone something completely different to what they paid for! Here's how you can
				avoid that...</p>
				<b>READ!</b>
				<p>It's as simple as that - simply read all of the details when you know someone has donated.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Applying the donation rewards</h3>
				<div class="ui green ribbon label">Easy-Medium difficulty</div>
				<p>Some of the donation rewards are automatically applied as soon as someone donates, with them also being removed when the
				donation expires (if it can expire). Examples of this are forum tags and access to donator-only forum categories, like the
				VIP forum category to name one.
				</p>
				<p>
				Unfortunately, the same doesn't apply for PermissionsEX ranks, as there seems to be a bug in CraftMine or PEX (PermissionsEX)
				that prevents Enjin	from setting ranks automatically, so we do this manually instead...
				</p>
				<p>
				There's two ways to do this:
				<ol>
					<li>Using the console and control panel normally</li>
					<li>Using the guided mode in the control panel</li>
				</ol>
				Either way's fine, but as I explained before, the first method is the quickest once you're used to it, and the second method is
				best when you forgot how to do it or when you're still learning how to do it. <i>or... if you're lazy. :P</i>
				</p>
				<h4>Method 1</h4>
				<i>Tip! Refer to the "Console" tutorial section for detailed help on setting ranks.</i>
				<ol>
					<li>Open up The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
					<li>Click on "Console" under the server section</li>
					<li>Enter the password to login to the console</li>
					<li>Set the appropriate rank</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>VIP: </b><code>pex user USERNAMEHERE group set VIP</code></li>
						<li><b>Legend: </b><code>pex user USERNAMEHERE group set Legend</code></li>
					</ul>
					<li>Let the user know that they have recieved what they paid for</li>
					<ul>
						<li><code>mail send USERNAMEHERE Your perks have been fully applied. Enjoy! :D</code></li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
				<h4>Method 2</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Open up The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
					<li>Hover over "Guides" in the menu on the left</li>
					<li>Click on "Apply donation reward"</li>
					<li>Follow the guided steps</li>
				</ol>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Congrats!</b> You've made it to the end of this tutorial. Now you'll be able to professionally provide the appropriate rewards
				to users when they donate. :)</p>

				<h2>Accessing the console</h2>
				<div class="ui green ribbon label">Easy difficulty</div>
				<p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to access the console so that you can run any command as a top-rank user.</p>
				<p>It's quite easy really, but just in case you're not sure, just keep reading... I'll tell you how to do it step by step. :)</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open up The Isla CP (Control Panel)</li>
					<li>Click on "Console" under the server section</li>
					<li>Enter the password to login to the console</li>

				<p>That's it! :D</p>
